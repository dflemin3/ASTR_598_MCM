    "- Works better for distributions that have quickly declining tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way:  Imagine you have a vary centrally peaked distribution with tails that die really quickly like a super narrow gaussian.  Any random (x0,y0) pair will be very unlikely to satisfy y0 < p(x0) in the tails since p(x0) is small, so not many x0 will be saved.  This recovered the distribution's behavior that not much stuff is out there.  If you hit the central peak, however, y0 < p(x0) will be likely to return true since p(x0) is large.  In this case, many x0 are returned recovering the behavior that the probability is high in that location.  The pileup of returned x0 is like the peak in the distribution (think histograms!)."
